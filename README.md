# Personal Machine Learning Projects in Python

This repository contains several machine learning projects implemented in Python. The projects cover various aspects of machine learning, including data cleaning, plotting, and training neural networks and deep learning models. Through these projects, I have acquired the basics of theoretical knowledge as well as practical skills in the field of neural networks and deep learning.


## Learning Journey:

Throughout these projects, I have learned:

- **Data Cleaning Techniques:** Understanding how to handle missing data, deal with outliers, and preprocess data for machine learning models.
- **Plotting in Python:** Utilizing libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations that aid in data exploration and analysis.
- **Neural Networks Basics:** Grasping the foundational concepts of neural networks, such as layers, activations, and backpropagation.
- **Deep Learning:** Delving into advanced deep learning architectures like CNNs and RNNs for tasks such as image classification, sequence prediction, and more.
